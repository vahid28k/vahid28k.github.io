I am a software engineer at 3DT Holdings, working on biomedical applications for cardiac mechanics. I develop advanced software tools that assist surgeons in performing precise and effective heart procedures. Prior to this, I worked as a machine learning scientist/engineer at General Motors, focusing on high definition mapping for ADAS applications. Before joining industry, I served as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Utah and the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, where I conducted research in computational science and engineering, focusing on scalable computational algorithms for design optimization and uncertainty quantification of complex engineering systems. My research interests are:

* Multifidelity-Multilevel Approaches for Uncertainty Quantification 
* Numerical Linear Algebra 
* Variational Inference and Statistical Learning 
* Scalable Gaussian Process Regression
* Large Scale Numerical Optimization

At a personal level, I have been working on an automated trading app, transforming my previous trading ideas —rooted in chart analysis— into code. I will be sharing some of my insights that may benefit others interested in automated trading.
