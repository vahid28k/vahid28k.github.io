I am currently a machine learning scientist in General Motors. I am broadly interested in predictive modeling and problems in computational science. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Utah. My research, primarily, focused on developing scalable computational algorithms for design optimization and uncertainty quantification of complex engineering systems pertinent to solid mechanics and structures. My research interests are:

* Multifidelity-Multilevel Approaches for Uncertainty Quantification 
* Numerical Linear Algebra 
* Variational Inference and Statistical Learning for Design Optimization
* Scalable Gaussian Process Regression
* Topology Optimization under Uncertainty
* Multiscale Topology Optimization
* Damage and Nonlocal Mechanics in Design Optimization
